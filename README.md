# RadarSupersenses-Arduino
This is an idea to improve race safety and performance in motorsport by giving "radar supersenses" to racecar drivers to help them understand what's happening behind their car. 

I developed this idea for the [Magneti Marelli's LaptimeClub](http://www.laptimeclub.com/) open innovation initiative, a community for boosting innovation in motorsport. I thought it could be fun to try to prototype this idea with Arduino to make a cool weekend project with my son.

The idea


The interface is based on a minimal led strip to suit an FIA Formula E single seater. I thougt to FIA Formula E, because with electric racecars the noise is almost absent and the driver "loses" an indirect instinctive idea of what's happening behind the car. An Unobtrusiveness is a fundamental requiste to help the driver to keep focusing on the race.
